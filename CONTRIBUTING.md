# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Developement

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](https://github.com/cibr-qcri/defi-robo-advisor/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cibr-qcri/defi-robo-advisor/issues/new/choose). It's that easy!
Don't forget to follow the template by adding all relevant details. People *love* thorough bug reports. We're not even kidding.
